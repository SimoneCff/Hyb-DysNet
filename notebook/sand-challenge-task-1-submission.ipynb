7. Inference & Submission Generation\n\nFinally, we generate predictions for the **Test Set**.\n\n1.  **Robust Loading:** We scan the test directory, handling potential file naming inconsistencies (flat structure vs. subfolders).\n2.  **Feature Extraction:** We apply the exact same Hybrid extraction (OpenSMILE + Wav2Vec2) used in training.\n3.  **Prediction:** The Ensemble predicts a class (1-5) for **every single audio file**.\n4.  **Majority Voting:** Since each subject has multiple audio files, we aggregate predictions by taking the **mode** (most frequent class) for each Subject ID.\n5.  **ID Formatting:** We ensure IDs match the submission format (e.g., `004` instead of `4`).\n\nThe final file `submission_task1.csv` is saved and ready for upload.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Percorsi forniti\nTEST_XLSX_PATH = \"/kaggle/input/and-test-dataset-task-1/task1/sand_task1_test.xlsx\"\nTEST_AUDIO_ROOT = \"/kaggle/input/and-test-dataset-task-1/task1/test\"","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-20T22:19:58.167798Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-20T22:19:58.168080Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-20T22:19:59.857998Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-20T22:19:58.168059Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-20T22:19:59.857412Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"🔍 --- DIAGNOSTICA PERCORSI ---\n✅ Excel trovato: /kaggle/input/and-test-dataset-task-1/task1/sand_task1_test.xlsx\n   Primi 3 ID nell'Excel: [4, 11, 14]\n✅ Cartella Audio trovata: /kaggle/input/and-test-dataset-task-1/task1/test\n   Esempio file trovato: /kaggle/input/and-test-dataset-task-1/task1/test/phonationE/ID235_phonationE.wav\n   Totale file .wav trovati: 536\n------------------------------\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":27},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def extract_features_for_test(path):\n    features = {}\n    try:\n        df_smile = smile.process_file(path)\n        df_smile.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n        for col in df_smile.columns:\n            features[f'smile_{col}'] = df_smile.iloc[0][col]\n    except: return None \n\n    try:\n        waveform, sr = torchaudio.load(path)\n        if sr != TARGET_SR:\n            waveform = torchaudio.functional.resample(waveform, sr, TARGET_SR)\n        target_samples = 5 * TARGET_SR\n        if waveform.shape[1] > target_samples: waveform = waveform[:, :target_samples]\n        else: waveform = torch.nn.functional.pad(waveform, (0, target_samples -
