# SAND Challenge Apply from the Parthenope Computational Intelligence & Smart Systems Lab (PCL) team

This repository contains our submission for the SAND (Speech Analysis for Neurodegenerative Diseases) Challenge, part of the IEEE ICASSP 2026 international conference.

The goal of this project is to develop an Artificial Intelligence system for the diagnosis and classification of dysarthria severity in ALS patients, using only vocal signals.

## Task 1: Multi-Class Classification (T0)
As per the challenge specifications, our primary focus is Task 1.

Objective: To identify the most reliable approach for correctly detecting and classifying the severity of voice disorders (dysarthria) by analyzing audio signals from the first assessment (T0).

The model must classify each subject into one of the following five classes:

- ALS with Severe dysarthria (Class 1)

- ALS with Moderate dysarthria (Class 2)

- ALS with Mild dysarthria (Class 3)

- ALS with No dysarthria (Class 4)

- Healthy Subject (Class 5)

## Task 2: Multi-Class Prediction (Latest Assessment)
Objective: To predict the ALSFRS-R scale of the patient assessed during the last follow-up visit (after a maximum of 11 months). The aim is to accurately predict how the condition will progress, enabling early intervention and better patient care.

For this task, four classes are considered:

- ALS with Severe dysarthria (Class 1)

- ALS with Moderate dysarthria (Class 2)

- ALS with Mild dysarthria (Class 3)

- ALS with No dysarthria (Class 4)
